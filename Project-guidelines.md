# Full-Stack Course Overview


## What to Expect in Phase 2 

You could stop here and look for jobs as a front-end web developer, but the field demands more. There are a plethora of opportunities for developers who can build their own back end. In the second phase, you will learn to build your own server code. 

As mentioned earlier, the second factor influencing how strong and quickly you learn something new is how you are able to take what you already know and make helpful connections with new material in order to develop a solid understanding of new concepts. Having a back end allows us to use a server to make and receive requests from the front end. An example of this is if a user clicks a login button, fills out their user information in the dialog box, and clicks submit, those credentials could be validated via a back-end server.

## Project 2

As a final project for the second phase, you'll combine your ability to create a front-end website with your new ability to write server code to create a site that interacts with your server code. Starting your second project from scratch instead of using the front end you developed in Project 1 helps reinforce your existing front-end abilities and solidify how you conceive of the front-end and back-end dynamic. If your front-end fundamentals are not strong at the end of the first project, you'll be building on a weak foundation. 



## Project Requirements
You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world full-stack application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:
* Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
* Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.
* Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
* Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
* Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed.
* Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
* Include authentication (express-session and cookies).
* Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
* Have a polished UI.
* Be responsive.
* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
* Meet good-quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
* Have a professional README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
